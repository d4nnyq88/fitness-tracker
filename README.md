# fitness-tracker
The Fitness Tracker project is a Node.js, Express, and MongoDB focused project requiring the use of the Express, Mongoose and Morgan packages. The app utilizes MongoDB to perform NoSQL queries to GET, POST, and PUT data into the MongoDB database. The App is initialized in a terminal using the command "npm start". When the App starts, the user will be presented a page with options to create a new workout or continue one (if one was previously created). The user can view a dashboard that tracks total duration and pounds lifted in workouts over the last 7 days. When users create a workout, they are given the option to add exercises to the workout by submitting details such as reps and sets in a form. If you want to finish your workout, select Complete Workout to close out the current one and begin a new one.
